                            Virtual reality surgery simulation works with medical imaging to convert CT and MRI images, enabling you to look at organs in three dimensions.
                             It is used as a surgical adjunct during preoperative planning in order to avoid any surprises and is a very vivid experience that allows you to replicate different scenarios of what goes on in the operating room and really what happens as you dissect.
                              Medical students can incorporate VR in their learning to gain a certain level of confidence that lets them work with more deft hands.

                        <p class="text-center"> For majority of design-led industries, the biggest challenge is often convincing the client that the finished product will look like or even better than the two dimensional representation.
                             Architecture is no different and that’s why virtual reality for design and architecture could help transform this industry.
                              The challenge of convincing clients can be resolved by using VR to transport the clients into a fully interactive 3D environment of a particular design as a whole.
                               VR is used by architects and designers from initial design mock-ups, to project collaboration, through to the finishing touches and it has unlimited capability to really sell an idea better than any other medium. </p>
